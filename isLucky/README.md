Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

_Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not._

**Example**

```
   For n = 1230, the output should be
   isLucky(n) = true;
   
   For n = 239017, the output should be
   isLucky(n) = false. 
```
